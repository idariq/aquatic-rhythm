# Aquatic Rhythm

**Aligned with living systems.**

## What This Is

Aquatic Rhythm is a small, independent project built around one observation: most aquarium problems are not mistakes — they are misalignment.

At its core is **ARA — Aquatic Rhythm Alignment** — a conceptual framework for reading closed aquatic ecosystems through rhythm, phase, and the reality of human care. ARA treats the aquarium not as a machine to be tuned, but as a living system that responds to patterns, consistency, and time.

This repository hosts the website and all associated project files.

---

## The Framework

ARA is built on four principles:

- **Timing before technique** — the right moment matters more than the right action
- **Capacity before ambition** — honest assessment of what your real life can sustain
- **Rhythm before intensity** — small consistent care outperforms dramatic intervention
- **Observation before correction** — watch and understand before you disturb

Behind these principles is a complete ecological system of thinking — five interlocking rhythms, three phases of system maturity, and a recognition that human behaviour is not external to the ecosystem. It is part of it.

## Rhyssa

Rhyssa is the conversational companion of Aquatic Rhythm, shaped by ARA.

She does not answer before she understands. She does not manufacture urgency where there is none. She moves at the pace living systems actually need.

Rhyssa is available as a floating companion on every page of the site, and also lives as a custom GPT on ChatGPT:

## Labs & Tools

Three interactive tools for planning, learning, and reading your tank:

### Tank Builder
Equipment and livestock planning lab. Choose fish first and discover what equipment they need — or build your setup first and see what species it can support. Tracks all five ARA rhythms (Water, Biological, Environmental, Livestock, Human) in real time as you build.

### Tank Cycle Simulator
Interactive nitrogen cycle simulator. Choose your tank size, cycling method, and plants — then watch the cycle unfold one simulated day at a time. Make real decisions (feeding, water changes, equipment) and see how the biology responds.

### Community Stress Lab
Ecological pressure map for hypothetical freshwater communities. Add up to 6 species and see overlapping pressures across six dimensions: thermal, chemistry, space, predation, social tension, and dwarf shrimp safety. For planning and learning — not a compatibility guarantee.

## Design System

All pages share a unified dark aquatic identity:

- **Background**: Deep blue-black gradient (`#050a08`) with animated water caustics and light rays
- **Accent**: Cyan (`#3DD6E8`) for interactive elements, status indicators, and highlights
- **Typography**: Cormorant Garamond (serif, headings and italic accents) + DM Sans (sans-serif, UI and body)
- **Header pattern**: `[Logo · AQUATIC Rhythm] ————— [⚙]` — consistent across all pages and tools
- **Intro pattern**: All tools (Tank Builder, Tank Simulator, Community Stress Lab) open with a branded briefing screen — same visual identity, tool-specific content

### Tool-specific header extensions

**Tank Simulator** — sub-toolbar below the header:
```
[☀️ Day N · status] ————————————— [+1d] [⏸ Pause]
```

**Settings button** on articles is auto-injected by `ar-page.js` — no per-file HTML changes needed.

## Security Operations

Baseline deployment and WAF tuning in front of origin GitHub Pages is documented at:

- [`docs/waf-github-pages.md`](docs/waf-github-pages.md)
- [`operations/security/post-deploy-header-validation.md`](operations/security/post-deploy-header-validation.md)

Security headers (CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, Referrer-Policy,
Permissions-Policy) are served via [`_headers`](_headers) at the edge.

---

## AI Companion Worker

The Rhyssa floating companion talks to Anthropic via a Cloudflare Worker so the API
key never reaches the browser. See [`worker/index.js`](worker/index.js) and
[`worker/wrangler.toml`](worker/wrangler.toml). The Worker enforces an origin allowlist,
bounds message size and history depth, and exposes a `/health` endpoint.

Deploy:

```bash
cd worker
wrangler deploy
wrangler secret put ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
```

---

## Developer Setup

The site is plain HTML/CSS/vanilla JS — no build step is required to view it.
Node tooling is only needed when running the i18n / sitemap scripts, lint, or tests.

Requirements: Node 18+ (tested on Node 20).

```bash
# Install dev dependencies (ESLint only)
npm install

# Static checks
npm run lint            # ESLint over js/, scripts/, worker/, tests/
npm run check:syntax    # `node --check` on every .js / .mjs file
npm test                # node --test (lightweight smoke tests)
npm run check           # lint + syntax + tests

# i18n / sitemap helpers (no install required — pure Node ESM)
node scripts/build-i18n.mjs --all
node scripts/build-reading-index.mjs
node scripts/update-sitemap.mjs
```

Serve locally with any static file server (e.g. `npx http-server .` or
`python3 -m http.server`). The SPA expects to be served from the repo root.

---

## Project Status

Aquatic Rhythm evolves slowly and deliberately.

Changes are made when understanding matures — not according to release cycles. The framework, the companion, and the website are all works in progress, shaped by use and observation over time.

This is not a finished product. It is a living exploration.
